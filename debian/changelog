splittar (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed permission denied warning on broken symlinks
  * Added better logging facilities (-d, -v, -q options)
  * Keep more than one tar file open so splittar can generate files
    with more consistent sizes
  * Added --version option to print out splittar's version
  * Improved documentation
  * Try to keep average file size to the specified maximum (this only applies
    when some of the files have become too large)
  * Close files that are too large so we can flush their buffers and get a
    better idea of just how big they really are
  * Added ability to change how much the past compression ratio affects the
    estimated size of a file (ratio weight parameter)
  * Fixed invalid size string handling
  * Small optimizations
